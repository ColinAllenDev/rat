/**
 * Make a list of functions that you need to know; matrix*vector, matrix*matrix,
 * create identity matrix, create x, y, and z rotation matrices, create translation matrix, etc.
 * Get a simplified theory for each one, try it on paper (particularly get the order
 * of matrix multiplication)
 * Start building a 3d maths cheat sheet
 * Quiz Yourself: 
 * - What happens if you multiply a vector by an identity matrix?
 * - What happens if you multiply a vector by a matrix of all zeros?
 * - What does a transposed version of a matrix look like?
 * - Can you rotate a vector using a rotation matrix?
 * - What happens mathematically when you multiply a trans matrix with a 4d vector ending in 0 or 1?
